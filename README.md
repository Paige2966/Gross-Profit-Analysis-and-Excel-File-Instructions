## ‚ùìBusiness Explorations

1. Which regions and product sizes are most and least profitable?

2. How does product mix impact gross profit margins?

3. Are there trends or patterns in profitability across time and region?

4. What are the best opportunities for increasing revenue or reducing cost?



## üîç Key Insights  

1. Regional Performance: 

    - The West region accounted for the highest gross profit and most sales volume, indicating strong product-market fit and customer engagement in that area.

    -  Smallest boomerangs had the lowest sales volume but the highest profit margins.

2. Product Size Trends:

    - Smallest boomerang sizes had the lowest sales volume and profit contribution, but consistently maintained higher margins.

    - Larger sizes dominated volume but had lower profit per unit, suggesting potential underpricing or higher cost ratios.

3. Product Mix Impact:

    - The company‚Äôs revenue is heavily skewed toward 2‚Äì3 SKUs, revealing an overdependence on a limited product set.

4. Time-based Patterns:

    - Monthly sales show consistent peaks in Q2 and Q4, suggesting seasonality or strong campaign performance during those periods.







## üí°Business Recommendations

1. Promote smallest boomerang sizes
   
   - These products have strong profit margins but low sales. Increasing visibility through bundled offers, ads, or seasonal promotions can boost volume profitably.

3. Focus investment in the West region
   
   - Since it leads in both gross profit and volume, reinforcing efforts here (ads, loyalty campaigns) can generate reliable growth.

5. Evaluate pricing strategies for larger sizes
   
   - Large boomerangs sell well but deliver lower profit per unit. Investigate COGS and adjust pricing or production costs to improve margin.

7. Diversify product performance
   
   - Reduce overdependence on 2‚Äì3 top products by pushing mid-tier SKUs through bundling or discounts.
