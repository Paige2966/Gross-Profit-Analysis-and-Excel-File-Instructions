5. What are the best opportunities for increasing revenue or reducing cost?
     - Created a calculated column titled "Profit Opportunity" with filters for "Review" & "Healthy". Review suggests the gross profit margin (GP%) is below 25%, meaning the product may not be generating enough profit.           Healthy suggests that the gross profit margin (GP%) is below 25%.

## üîç Key Insights  

1. Gross profit margin is below 25% for all products and category's indicating high production costs, pricing inefficiencies, or thin margins, prompting a review of cost structures or pricing strategies.  


2. Regional Performance: 

    - The West region accounted for the highest gross profit and most sales volume, indicating strong product-market fit and customer engagement in that area.

    -  Smallest boomerangs had the lowest sales volume but the highest profit margins.


3. Time-based Patterns:

    - Monthly sales show consistent peaks in Q4 (December), suggesting seasonality or strong campaign performance during those periods.


4. Product Mix %:
   
      - Showing the percentage share of each product in the total mix. Higher percentages indicate products that contribute more significantly to revenue.

        ‚úî Margin Categories: Your chart categorizes products into High Margin and Low Margin, helping identify which products generate the most profit.

        ‚úî Insights to Highlight:
        
        - Quad dominates the mix, but it primarily falls under Low Margin, meaning it sells a lot but isn't as profitable.
        - Fun Fly has the most presence in High Margin, indicating strong profitability despite a lower percentage in product mix.
        - Other products, like Bellen and Bower Aussie Round, show smaller contributions, suggesting their impact on overall margin is more limited.



## üí°Business Recommendations

1. Promote smallest boomerang sizes
   
   - Increasing visibility through bundled offers, ads, or seasonal promotions can boost volume profitably.

2. Option 1:  Focus on strategies to increase profitability across all regions by reducing Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):
    - Negotiate Supplier Costs ‚Äì Renegotiate contracts with vendors to secure better pricing or bulk discounts.
    - Optimize Inventory Management ‚Äì Reduce waste, excess stock, and inefficient purchasing practices.
    - Improve Production Efficiency ‚Äì Streamline processes, reduce defects, and lower operational costs.

  
   Option 2:  Adjust Pricing Strategies:
    - Increase Prices Strategically ‚Äì Analyze which products can sustain a price increase without losing demand.
    - Introduce Tiered Pricing ‚Äì Offer premium versions of products with higher perceived value and pricing flexibility.
    - Bundle Products ‚Äì Combine lower-margin items with high-margin ones to improve overall profitability.


4. Focus investment in the West region
   
   - Since it leads in both gross profit and volume, reinforcing efforts here (ads, loyalty campaigns) can generate reliable growth.

5. Evaluate pricing strategies for larger sizes
   
   - Large boomerangs sell well but deliver lower profit per unit. Investigate COGS and adjust pricing or production costs to improve margin.
