## ‚ùìBusiness Explorations

1. Gross Profit from Gel Boomerang sales broken down by skill level (Category) and individual Products.
  
3. Profit trends over time.

4. Which regions and product sizes are most and least profitable? Matrix table on the Gross Profit tab highlights profitability extremes.
   
5. How does product mix impact gross profit margins?  Scatter plot on the profit margin tab shows which products are revenue drivers and which are margin-efficient.

6. What are the best opportunities for increasing revenue or reducing cost?



## üîç Key Insights  

1. Gross profit margin is below 25% for all products and category's indicating high production costs, pricing inefficiencies, or thin margins, prompting a review of cost structures or pricing strategies.  


2. Regional Performance: 

    - The West region accounted for the highest gross profit and most sales volume, indicating strong product-market fit and customer engagement in that area.

    -  Smallest boomerangs had the lowest sales volume but the highest profit margins.


3. Time-based Patterns:

    - Monthly sales show consistent peaks in Q4 (December), suggesting seasonality or strong campaign performance during those periods.





## üí°Business Recommendations

1. Promote smallest boomerang sizes
   
   - Increasing visibility through bundled offers, ads, or seasonal promotions can boost volume profitably.

2. Focus on strategies to increase profitability across all regions by reducing Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):

    - Negotiate Supplier Costs ‚Äì Renegotiate contracts with vendors to secure better pricing or bulk discounts.
    - Optimize Inventory Management ‚Äì Reduce waste, excess stock, and inefficient purchasing practices.
    - Improve Production Efficiency ‚Äì Streamline processes, reduce defects, and lower operational costs.


3. Focus investment in the West region
   
   - Since it leads in both gross profit and volume, reinforcing efforts here (ads, loyalty campaigns) can generate reliable growth.

4. Evaluate pricing strategies for larger sizes
   
   - Large boomerangs sell well but deliver lower profit per unit. Investigate COGS and adjust pricing or production costs to improve margin.
