## üß© Project Overview
This project offers an end-to-end financial analysis of Gel Boomerang‚Äôs top 10 sales data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The focus is on gross profit trends, regional and product performance by product type, and strategic opportunities to maximize profitability.

      Filtered by Country

4. How does product mix impact gross profit margins?  (see the Scatter plot on the profit margin tab that shows which products are revenue drivers and which are margin-efficient).
    - Created a calculated column titled "GP (%)

5. What are the best opportunities for increasing revenue or reducing cost?
     - Created a calculated column titled "Profit Opportunity" with filters for "Review" & "Healthy". Review suggests the gross profit margin (GP%) is below 25%, meaning the product may not be generating enough profit.           Healthy suggests that the gross profit margin (GP%) is below 25%.

## üîç Key Insights  

1. Gross profit margin is below 25% for all products and category's indicating high production costs, pricing inefficiencies, or thin margins, prompting a review of cost structures or pricing strategies.  


2. Regional Performance: 

    - The West region accounted for the highest gross profit and most sales volume, indicating strong product-market fit and customer engagement in that area.

    -  Smallest boomerangs had the lowest sales volume but the highest profit margins.


3. Time-based Patterns:

    - Monthly sales show consistent peaks in Q4 (December), suggesting seasonality or strong campaign performance during those periods.





## üí°Business Recommendations

1. Promote smallest boomerang sizes
   
   - Increasing visibility through bundled offers, ads, or seasonal promotions can boost volume profitably.

2. Option 1:  Focus on strategies to increase profitability across all regions by reducing Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):
    - Negotiate Supplier Costs ‚Äì Renegotiate contracts with vendors to secure better pricing or bulk discounts.
    - Optimize Inventory Management ‚Äì Reduce waste, excess stock, and inefficient purchasing practices.
    - Improve Production Efficiency ‚Äì Streamline processes, reduce defects, and lower operational costs.

  Option 2:  Adjust Pricing Strategies:
    - Increase Prices Strategically ‚Äì Analyze which products can sustain a price increase without losing demand.
    - Introduce Tiered Pricing ‚Äì Offer premium versions of products with higher perceived value and pricing flexibility.
    - Bundle Products ‚Äì Combine lower-margin items with high-margin ones to improve overall profitability.


4. Focus investment in the West region
   
   - Since it leads in both gross profit and volume, reinforcing efforts here (ads, loyalty campaigns) can generate reliable growth.

5. Evaluate pricing strategies for larger sizes
   
   - Large boomerangs sell well but deliver lower profit per unit. Investigate COGS and adjust pricing or production costs to improve margin.
